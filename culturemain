Chess, checkers, as well as marble games remain popular among Ižtér youth, despite the presence of more modern pasttimes.
Pétanque is more commonly enjoyed by adults and seniors, and most often played on the gravel or hard dirt spaces of public parks.
Commuters in Ižtéria do not talk aloud or take phone calls on public transport: doing so is frowned upon. If necessary, someone will whisper to another, but nothing louder.
